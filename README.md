# refried

A collection of plugins and scripts for
[beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) and
[fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava) for monthly budgeting.
Budgeting-related plugins inspired by
[You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com).

## Installation

Install this plugin from PyPI:

```bash
pip install beancount-refried
```

Alternatively, if you want to be able to edit the plugins locally,
you can clone this repository then run the following from within
the root of the repository:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The Fava extensions are currently tested against fava v1.26.1; you may have errors when using other versions.

## Quick start

Enable the `rebudget` beancount plugin and the `avail_ext` fava extension
by adding the following lines to your beancount file:

```
plugin "refried.plugins.rebudget"
2020-01-01 custom "fava-extension" "refried.extensions.avail_ext"
```

This will add a new report "Budget" to fava. The `rebudget` plugin is
required for it to function properly.

See the document on [YNAB-style budgeting](docs/budgeting.md) for details.

## Customization

The fava extensions allow you to specify more user friendly names by using a
`name: <str>` metadata on an account's `open` directive.

You can also influence the ordering of displayed accounts using an `ordering:
<number>` metadata on an account's `open` directive if you don't want the
default alphabetic ordering.
You can also use Decimals or strings of the form "<number>.<number>.<number>..."
to easily insert new accounts between two adjacent accounts.
For example, "23.64.2" would be ordered between "23.64" and "23.65".

Some of the plugins/extensions may currently make assumptions about currency (USD) and
various account names.
